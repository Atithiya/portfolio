## About me

Hello, I'm Atithiya Inthorn, a recent graduate of the Generation Thailand Bootcamp. With a solid two-year background in the document verification industry, I've successfully pivoted to software development, refining both essential technical and soft skills.

My genuine passion for software development is anchored in robust technical abilities. I recently played a pivotal role in engineering a MERN Stack Workout Tracking Web Application, leveraging my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Engaging within an agile framework, I actively contributed to sprint planning, weekly scrum meetings, and retrospectives, ensuring the project's successful delivery.

My proficiency in executing software testing protocols, acquired through the "Software Testing Manual by P'Beam Course," allowed me to guarantee the seamless functionality of the application. I am adept at crafting and implementing test cases and scenarios. Dedicated, hardworking, and consistently eager to learn, I am now prepared to apply my skills in a challenging Software Quality Assurance Engineer role.

Throughout this project, I utilized a diverse set of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, and applied industry-standard testing methodologies and tools to ensure the application's high-quality performance.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing my varied skills to a dynamic software quality assurance environment and contributing to the continued success of your team.
