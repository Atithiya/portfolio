## About me

My name is Atithiya Inthorn. I graduated from the Generation Thailand Bootcamp, where I acquired essential
technical and soft skills for transitioning from a two-year career in the document
verification industry. My genuine interest in software development is supported
by robust technical abilities. Dedicated, hardworking, and consistently eager to
learn, I am ready to apply my skills in a challenging Software Quality Assurance
Engineer role.
